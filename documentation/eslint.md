# Eslint
##### If you are using vscode, I highly recommend that you download the Eslint extension by Microsoft. It helps keep all your code consistent and organized.


## How To Configure Eslint
* Download Eslint extension by Microsoft.
* Add 2 files: .eslintrc.yml and .eslintignore.
* There are examples of these in this project.
* You can configure these to your own liking.
```bash
# If you have issues try this link:

# You may need to run this command
npm install -g install-peerdeps
install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
```
