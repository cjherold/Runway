### Setup
###### Here is how you get up and running. [More](./documentation/setup.md)


***
### Startup
###### This project uses gulp as a task manager



```bash

# make sure that .env is in the .gitignore file (this one is an example for reference only)
# remove .git and run
git init

# install node_modules
npm i

# basic start
npm start

# development start
npm run dev
```
***
### Files to add
* .gitignore has a few things that are going to be left out, but are highly recommended
* .env with a PORT
* _notes folder is recommended as a handy place to store temp files and notes.
* Here is a sample of how ./ will look
