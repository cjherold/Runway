# Runway
A quick way to get a website up to speed and off the ground.

# Notice: Project is still being finished so this readme is not quite ready...

## About
##### All the main features of this project can be seen by the example pages already here. These pages try to utilize things like routes, middleware, classes, modules, scss, and the env file.




## Routes
#### Overview
##### These routes are configured in the app.routes.js file. The middleware is also there and is linked to the pages that use them.
#### Classes
* A good way to separate large code sections and error checking from the routes.
* Also allows the code to be more extensible and reusable.
#### Middleware
* Very useful for passing information into the request.
* Cleans up things like meta tags, scripts, stylesheets, long lists, and more into a easy to mainain js object that is stored in its own file.
